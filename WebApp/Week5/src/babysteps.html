		<h1>Introduction</h1> 
		<p class="centersubtext">Babysteps is a pregnancy hub that helps expecting parents keep track 
			of important dates, correspond with doctors, and collect and store 
			all images, videos, and audio clips gathered during medically safe 
			ultrasound exams. In the development of this project I contributed 
			all UX/UI designs to give patients a way to track their pregnancies, 
			and create an app that would encourage positive relations between 
			parents and their healthcare providers.</p>

	<article class="centertext" id="process">
		<h1>Process</h1> 
		<p class="centersubtext">This project began with a visit to a Milwakee-based ultrasound 
			"party clinic" to observe how technicians go about sharing all 
			collected visuals and audio clips with expecting parents. An ideation 
			phase then followed to map out the user experience of the clinics and 
			to establish which aspects could be incorporated back into a medical 
			setting by way of a smartphone app.</p>

		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<p class="centersubtext">Not only did this project become my first exploration into digital UI design, 
			but it also became a unique exploration into the medical industry's response 
			to the divide between strictly medical and "extraneous" ultrasound exams. 
			This created an opportunity to design a comprehensive system to ensure the 
			safety of expecting mothers while giving them a platform through which to track 
			and share their child's growth.</p>
