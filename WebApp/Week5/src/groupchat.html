		<h1>Introduction</h1> 
		<p class="centersubtext">Group.Chat is an online community that was created to allow students 
			to browse existing projects and profiles within their university and 
			to collaborate on peer-to-peer tutoring and group work. In the 
			development of this project, I performed user research, went through 
			each step of the ISO user experience design process, as well as 
			developed the visual look and feel of the interface design (this 
			project was developed for IDM21.)</p>

		<h1>Process</h1> 
		<p class="centersubtext">This project began with research into the users by creating user 
			profiles and personae. Following this step, task scenarios were 
			written, and the information was mapped into task models and 
			conceptual models. Wireframes and a visual design were created using 
			iOS standards. Finally, usability tests were performed by 
			interviewing students in University of Brighton’s IDM21 class.</p>

		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<p class="centersubtext">Not only was this project the first I developed through the 
			ISO process, but it also became a unique exploration into the need 
			for collaborative platforms catered towards university students. 
			This project was an opportunity to perform in-depth user research, 
			and collaborate with peers in the IDM21 module to create a platform 
			suited for their needs.</p>
