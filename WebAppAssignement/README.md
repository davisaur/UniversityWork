Day 1)

So far I've managed to create a decent looking front end, with a map on the left side and listings on the right. It shows availability, address and image of the skip/item.

With that said though, clicking on anything does absolutely nothing and the search bar at the top does not function. There is NO backend at this stage. It has all been designed primarily in HTML & CSS.

My next plan of action is to create a modal for when you click on each item (or maybe this should be its own individual page?), and I need to create the button and page to be able to add to the page.

Feeling pretty confident with the project thus far.
